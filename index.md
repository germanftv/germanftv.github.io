## About Me

I am a doctoral student at [Computer Vision Group, Tampere University, Finland](https://research.tuni.fi/vision/), under the supervision of [Prof. Joni Kämäräinen](https://webpages.tuni.fi/vision/public_pages/JoniKamarainen/index.html). My research work focuses on multi-modal image and video restoration problems.

In 2020, I completed my Master's degree in Data Engineering and Machine Learning at Tampere University. Prior to that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Electronics Engineering from Universidad Industrial de Santander, Bucaramanga, Colombia. During my super senior year, I conducted research on mamographic image processing under the guidance of [Prof. Said Pertuz](https://sites.google.com/view/cvia/home), which sparked my interest in the field of computer vision.
